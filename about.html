            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Originally from Ohio, I currently live in Northern Virginia, near Washington D.C. Until recently I was a
                consultant to the U.S. Government, focused in the field of Insider Threats. I enrolled at Coding Temple
                because I was looking for a change in career, but more on that later. I have done many different things
                in my life and have changed careers on no less than 4 occasions.</p>
            <p>Intending to eventually become an engineer, I worked at factories out of high school, learning a wide
                arrays of different skills, including electrical, welding, and machining. I then enlisted in the United
                States Army, becoming an Arabic Linguist. The Arabic program taught me to be fluent in 64 weeks, which
                I hope prepares me for the "fire hose" that this course promises to be. I served six years in the Army
                before contracting
                to the Government as an Insider Threat Analyst, trying to find the next Timothy McVeigh or Edward
                Snowden. It was rewarding but now I'm looking for a change.</p>
            <h1>Why Now?</h1>
            <p>Shortly after I left the military, I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. We
                learned Java during the course of that program so I'm hoping that can help me learn Python a little
                easier. I never had a chance to use my skills professionally so they atrophied to the point that I was
                no longer marketable. I decided that if I really wanted to do this, then I needed a drastic switch. What
                I really hope to gain from this course is freedom. Freedom to work on exciting projects or the freedom
                to work anywhere in the world.</p>
